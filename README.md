# ForwardFuelWebsite
Website for our team's solution (from Queen's University) to the 2017 SHAD Entrepreneurial Cup Project problem of "How might Canadians reduce our individual energy footprint?" The website was created using HTMl, CSS, and Javascript. The CSS was minified to increase the loading speed of the webpages.
